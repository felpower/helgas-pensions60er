# 🎤 YouTube Integration Examples

## Perfect for Your Mom's Singing Career! 🌟

Since your mom was a singer, YouTube integration is perfect! No need to download large video files - just use the YouTube URLs directly.

## 📝 How to Add YouTube Videos

### Step 1: Find Your YouTube Videos
Get the URLs of your mom's singing performances on YouTube. Any of these formats work:
- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123def456`
- `https://youtu.be/abc123def456`
- `https://www.youtube.com/embed/abc123def456`

### Step 2: Update the Video Array
In `src/App.vue`, find the `familyVideos` array (around line 234) and replace it with your videos:

```javascript
const familyVideos = ref([
  { 
    id: 1, 
    src: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID_1', 
    caption: 'Helga singing "My Way" at the local theater! 🎭✨',
    type: 'youtube'
  },
  { 
    id: 2, 
    src: 'https://youtu.be/YOUR_VIDEO_ID_2', 
    caption: 'Beautiful rendition of "Edelweiss" 🌸🎵',
    type: 'youtube'
  },
  { 
    id: 3, 
    src: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID_3', 
    caption: 'Choir performance - Helga\'s amazing solo! 🎤👑',
    type: 'youtube'

  { 
    id: 4, 
    src: 'https://youtu.be/YOUR_VIDEO_ID_4',
